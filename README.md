 ### *The FoodDeliveryApp project is a microservices architecture made up of four main*
### *components: product service, order service, notifications and inventory control.*
### *Each microservice plays a specific role in the food delivery ecosystem, ranging from* 
### *product management to inventory control, ordering services and notifications.* 
### *This modular approach allows for scalability, easier maintenance, and flexibility*
